Without a unifying enterprise architecture framework the following challenges commonly emerge:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Siloed initiatives and poor business buy‑in.</strong> Many EA teams complain that “the rest of the business appears to be uninterested.” Without executive sponsorship or departmental engagement, initiatives stall <a href=https://www.valueblue.com/blog/7-common-enterprise-architecture-challenges-and-how-to-solve-them>(valueblue.com)</a>.

Recent guidance emphasises that TOGAF is not just a governance model; it provides principles, best practices and an <em>Architecture Development Method (ADM)</em> to iteratively develop and maintain an enterprise architecture <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p><p>Key benefits include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Streamlined IT operations.</strong> By clearly framing processes, roles and assets, TOGAF improves understanding of how things work and helps reduce redundancy in systems <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Better strategic alignment.</strong> TOGAF bridges the gap between IT and business by providing a framework for aligning IT strategies and capabilities with business goals <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved interoperability.</strong> Mapping the enterprise reveals where systems are siloed and allows teams to set interoperability standards <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Standardised architectural framing.</strong> Using a common framework makes it easier to work with consultants and reuse established patterns <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrated governance and risk management.</strong> TOGAF embeds governance practices to help identify and manage risks associated with IT architecture <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id=3selected-use-case--integrated-customer-and-product-data>3 Selected use case – integrated customer and product data</h2><p>To illustrate how TOGAF can solve real business problems, consider a <strong>Unified Customer and Product Data</strong> initiative. Today, customer and product information exists in multiple systems:</p><ol><li><em>Salesforce CRM</em> holds customer interactions and pipeline data.</li><li><em>Oracle ERP</em> maintains orders, product catalogue and financial data.</li><li><em>HR and PMO systems</em> store employee and project information for resource allocation.</li><li><em>Data Warehouse/Data Lake</em> stores analytical data used by the Data Analytics team.</li></ol><p>Without an enterprise architecture, these systems are integrated via ad‑hoc scripts and spreadsheets. HR might enter employee skills in one tool while PMO enters resource assignments in another, causing conflicting information. The Data Analytics team receives periodic extracts instead of real‑time feeds. Departments duplicate data structures, leading to inconsistent definitions of customers, products or projects.</p><p>The goal of the use case is to create a single view of customers and products, enable cross‑departmental reporting (e.g., product profitability, customer lifetime value, resource utilisation), and provide near‑real‑time data feeds for analytics. The following sections show how TOGAF’s domains help achieve this.</p><h2 id=4applying-togafs-architecture-domains>4 Applying TOGAF’s architecture domains</h2><h3 id=41businessarchitecture>4.1 Business Architecture</h3><p>The <em>business architecture</em> domain focuses on the organization’s motivations, operations and alignment with strategy <a href=https://togaf.visual-paradigm.com/2025/02/18/comprehensive-guide-to-architecture-domains-in-togaf>(togaf.visual-paradigm.com)</a>. For the unified data initiative:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Identify business capabilities and processes.</strong> Map the capabilities of each department (e.g., sales operations, order processing, data analytics, project management, HR hiring/training, quality assurance, innovation/R&amp;D). Create a capability map to understand overlaps and dependencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define strategic objectives and performance metrics.</strong> For example, reduce time‑to‑report by 50 %, improve resource utilisation by 20 % and increase customer satisfaction scores. Align these objectives with enterprise goals (growth, cost optimisation, innovation).</p></li><li><p><strong>Stakeholder engagement.</strong> Address the lack of business buy‑in by involving executives from sales, operations, HR and PMO at the start. Translate EA activities into tangible outcomes such as faster on‑boarding of new products and improved decision‑making <a href=https://www.valueblue.com/blog/7-common-enterprise-architecture-challenges-and-how-to-solve-them>(valueblue.com)</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id=42dataarchitecture>4.2 Data Architecture</h3><p><strong>Data architecture</strong> deals with the structure of data assets, governance and integration <a href=https://togaf.visual-paradigm.com/2025/02/18/comprehensive-guide-to-architecture-domains-in-togaf>(togaf.visual-paradigm.com)</a>. In this use case:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Develop a common data model.</strong> Harmonise customer, product, order and project data across systems. The simplified entity–relationship model below illustrates key entities such as <em>Customer</em>, <em>Product</em>, <em>SalesOrder</em>, <em>OrderItem</em>, <em>Project</em>, <em>Employee</em> and <em>ResourceAllocation</em>. It defines primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK) and relationships to ensure consistency across applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define data governance policies.</strong> Establish data quality standards, ownership and stewardship. For example, the sales department owns customer data, while product management owns product definitions. Data stewards enforce naming conventions and manage metadata.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan for data integration and lineage.</strong> Decide how data moves from operational systems (Salesforce, Oracle ERP, HR) into the data warehouse and analytics platform. Use an integration layer to expose APIs and implement ETL/ELT pipelines. Ensure traceability so analysts understand the origin and transformation of each data element.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure regulatory compliance.</strong> By documenting data flows and applying security controls, the organization meets legal obligations and protects sensitive information <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li></ul><h3 id=43applicationarchitecture>4.3 Application Architecture</h3><p>The <strong>applications architecture</strong> describes the behaviour of applications and services that support business processes <a href=https://togaf.visual-paradigm.com/2025/02/18/comprehensive-guide-to-architecture-domains-in-togaf>(togaf.visual-paradigm.com)</a>. For our use case:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Inventory existing applications.</strong> Document the functions provided by Salesforce (CRM), Oracle ERP (order management, product master), HR and PMO systems (employee and project management), QA tools and analytics platforms. Identify overlapping functionality (e.g., duplicate resource scheduling features) and opportunities to rationalise.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design integration patterns.</strong> Introduce an <em>Integration Layer</em> using an API Gateway or Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Each system exposes APIs to the integration layer, which manages authentication, orchestration and protocol translation. This reduces point‑to‑point integrations and ensures loose coupling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan application services.</strong> For example, a <em>Customer Service</em> retrieves customer details by combining CRM and ERP data, while a <em>Resource Allocation Service</em> unifies project assignments across PMO and HR systems. A <em>Reporting Service</em> fetches curated data from the analytics platform for dashboards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define non‑functional requirements.</strong> Consider availability, scalability and performance. Adopt service‑oriented or microservice principles to enable independent deployment and scalability.</p></li></ul><h3 id=44technologyarchitecture>4.4 Technology Architecture</h3><p>The <strong>technology architecture</strong> domain outlines the infrastructure required to support applications <a href=https://togaf.visual-paradigm.com/2025/02/18/comprehensive-guide-to-architecture-domains-in-togaf>(togaf.visual-paradigm.com)</a>. Key activities include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Assess current infrastructure.</strong> Catalog servers, databases, networks and cloud services used by each department. Identify obsolete components and areas where cost can be optimised (e.g., decommission redundant servers, consolidate environments).</p></li><li><p><strong>Define target infrastructure.</strong> For this use case, deploy the integration layer on a scalable platform (e.g., containers or managed integration services), adopt a secure API gateway, implement data pipelines (streaming and batch) and provision a data lake/warehouse environment with sufficient compute and storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set technology standards.</strong> Specify approved platforms (e.g., PostgreSQL for the data warehouse, AWS/Azure integration services), interoperability protocols (REST, GraphQL, messaging), security standards (encryption, access control) and disaster‑recovery plans.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan migration.</strong> Use the ADM’s Phase F to create a migration roadmap that sequences transitions from legacy batch extracts to modern API‑driven integration, minimises disruption and allows incremental adoption <a href=https://www.ardoq.com/knowledge-hub/togaf#>(ardoq.com)</a>.</p></li></ul><h2 id=5-executing-the-initiative-with-togaf-adm>5.

TOGAF provides a comprehensive framework to address these issues by aligning business objectives with data, application and technology architectures and by guiding the implementation through an iterative ADM cycle. The unified customer and product data use case illustrates how TOGAF helps an organisation move from fragmented systems to an integrated, data‑driven ecosystem that supports informed decision‑making and continuous improvement.</p></div></div></article><div class="mt4 ph3 mw8 center"><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Previous chapter: </span><a href=/guides/accountability-vs-responsibility/>Accountability VS Responsibility</a></p></div></main><footer class="bg-white bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="center f4 fw4 dim no-underline black-50 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://srikanthdoddi.com/>&copy; Srikanth Doddi 2025</a></div></footer></body></html>
