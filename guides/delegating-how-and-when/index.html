Here are ideal moments to consider it:</p><h4 id=1-when-a-task-is-repeatable-or-operational>1. When a task is repeatable or operational</h4><p>Routine tasks that don’t require your direct input are great candidates for delegation.</p><h4 id=2-when-someone-else-has-or-can-build-the-skill>2. When someone else has (or can build) the skill</h4><p>If someone on your team is equipped—or eager—to learn, give them the opportunity.</p><h4 id=3-when-its-a-growth-opportunity>3. When it’s a growth opportunity</h4><p>Delegation can stretch team members and expose them to decision-making, cross-functional work, or new technologies.</p><h4 id=4-when-it-frees-you-to-focus-on-strategic-work>4. When it frees you to focus on strategic work</h4><p>Leadership requires space for vision, culture, and innovation. Delegate to gain that space.</p><h2 id=-when-not-to-delegate>🚫 When Not to Delegate</h2><ul><li>Critical tasks that require your <em>unique expertise or judgment</em></li><li>Tasks involving <em>sensitive personal issues</em> (e.g., performance reviews)</li><li>Work for which the delegatee lacks <em>capacity or readiness</em>, without time to support them</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-delegate-effectively>How to Delegate Effectively</h2><h4 id=1-choose-the-right-person>1. Choose the Right Person</h4><p>Match the task to the team member’s <strong>skills, interest, and development level</strong> (think <em>Situational Leadership</em>).</p><h4 id=2-clearly-define-the-outcome>2. Clearly Define the Outcome</h4><p>Explain:</p><ul><li>What success looks like</li><li>Deadlines</li><li>Key deliverables</li></ul><p>Avoid vague expectations clarity upfront saves time later.</p><h4 id=3-give-context-not-just-tasks>3. Give Context, Not Just Tasks</h4><p>Let them know <em>why</em> the task matters. This builds ownership and aligns their approach with the bigger picture.</p><h4 id=4-set-checkpoints-not-micromanagement>4. Set Checkpoints, Not Micromanagement</h4><p>Schedule light touch-ins for alignment and support, especially early on. Too much oversight kills initiative; too little may lead to missed goals.</p><h4 id=5-support-without-taking-over>5. Support Without Taking Over</h4><p>Be available to guide, but resist the urge to <em>&ldquo;just fix it&rdquo;</em> yourself. Let them learn, even if it means a small delay.</p><h4 id=6-recognize-and-reflect>6. Recognize and Reflect</h4><p>Acknowledge the work publicly, offer feedback, and discuss what went well or could improve next time.</p><h2 id=-framework-the-5-levels-of-delegation>🧠 Framework: The 5 Levels of Delegation</h2><p>Adapted from leadership expert Michael Hyatt, these levels help you communicate the <em>degree of autonomy</em>:</p><ol><li><em>Do exactly what I say.</em></li><li><em>Research and report back.</em></li><li><em>Research, recommend, and let me decide.</em></li><li><em>Make a decision, but inform me.</em></li><li><em>Own the decision—no need to report unless there&rsquo;s a problem.</em></li></ol><p>This helps align expectations and builds trust progressively.</p><h2 id=example-in-engineering-leadership>Example in Engineering Leadership</h2><h3 id=scenario>Scenario:</h3><p><em>You’re a tech lead, and a new platform initiative is starting.
