If you want to scale your leadership, you have to scale trust. That means letting go of control—not blindly, but progressively.

The Freedom Ladder is a simple but powerful tool for thinking about how leaders delegate work and decision-making. At each rung of the ladder, the balance between managerial control and individual autonomy shifts until responsibility is fully owned by the contributor.
This model is especially useful for Staff-plus engineers who need to scale impact by empowering others, not just doing the work themselves."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="map[name:Srikanth Doddi]"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.efe4d852f731d5d1fbb87718387202a97aafd768cdcdaed0662bbe6982e91824.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/static/pygments.css><link rel=canonical href=https://techleadmanager.com/guides/freedom-ladder/><meta property="og:url" content="https://techleadmanager.com/guides/freedom-ladder/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="From Code to Influence: A Software Engineer’s Journey"><meta property="og:title" content="Climbing the Freedom Ladder"><meta property="og:description" content="If you want to scale your leadership, you have to scale trust.

That means letting go of control—not blindly, but progressively.<br>- <a href=https://staffeng.com/guides/stories/adrian-lee>Adrian Lee</a></p></blockquote><p>The <em>Freedom Ladder</em> is a simple but powerful tool for thinking about how leaders delegate work and decision-making. At each rung of the ladder, the balance between <em>managerial control</em> and <em>individual autonomy</em> shifts until responsibility is fully owned by the contributor.</p><p>This model is especially useful for Staff-plus engineers who need to <em>scale impact</em> by empowering others, not just doing the work themselves.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-freedom-ladder>What is the Freedom Ladder?</h2><p>The Freedom Ladder defines five levels of autonomy:</p><ol><li><em>Wait until told</em> – The individual takes no action without instruction.</li><li><em>Ask what to do next</em> – The individual signals readiness, but defers decision-making.</li><li><em>Suggest, check before acting</em> – The individual proposes action, manager approves.</li><li><em>Report afterwards</em> – The individual acts independently, then updates the manager.</li><li><em>Free to act, routine reporting only</em> – Full autonomy within defined boundaries.</li></ol><p>Each step up the ladder gives the individual more <em>challenge and fulfillment</em>, while freeing the manager to focus on <em>strategic objectives</em>.</p><p>The ladder implicitly addresses varying <em>levels of grip</em>: how tightly or loosely a manager holds control over outcomes. That grip should shift based on the person&rsquo;s experience, the risk of the work, and the urgency of results.</p><h2 id=why-it-matters-at-staff-plus-level>Why it matters at Staff-plus level</h2><p>In a Staff-plus role, <em>you are the system</em>. You aren’t just delivering on your own work you’re enabling others. The Freedom Ladder helps you think clearly about <em>who should own what</em>, and how much autonomy they’re ready for.</p><p>Some examples:</p><ul><li>New engineers might start at “Ask what to do next.”</li><li>A Staff engineer taking on new domain work may be at “Suggest check before acting.”</li><li>A senior IC with proven judgment might be operating at “Report afterwards” or “Free to act.”</li></ul><p>Helping others <em>climb this ladder</em> is one of the most powerful ways to build a resilient, high-performing team.</p><h2 id=internal-visibility>Internal visibility</h2><p>Your role isn’t just to give freedom, but to do so <em>transparently</em> in a way that shows thoughtful delegation rather than disengagement.</p><p>You can create internal visibility by:</p><ul><li>Making expectations explicit: “I trust you to decide and just report back.”</li><li>Communicating changes in delegation style: “You’ve earned full autonomy here.”</li><li>Documenting ladders or delegation levels for different projects.</li><li>Encouraging retros on autonomy and decision-making.</li></ul><p>Well-documented and well-explained delegation boosts psychological safety and reinforces that autonomy is earned, not assumed.</p><h2 id=executive-visibility>Executive visibility</h2><p>Executives don’t just want to know <em>what</em> you did they want to know <em>how</em> you scaled yourself. Moving your team members up the Freedom Ladder is a powerful narrative in a <a href=https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets/>promotion packet</a> or stakeholder review.</p><p>You can show this by:</p><ul><li>Describing how you reduced your own control on a critical project.</li><li>Showing growth in a teammate’s decision-making maturity.</li><li>Highlighting a system or protocol you put in place that lets others act autonomously.</li></ul><p>When you increase others’ autonomy responsibly, you increase the system’s capacity an executive-level trait.</p><h2 id=external-visibility>External visibility</h2><p>The Freedom Ladder is also a great tool to share externally as part of your leadership narrative. Consider:</p><ul><li>Writing a blog post about how you helped an engineer “earn” full autonomy.</li><li>Giving a talk about scaling trust and ownership in distributed teams.</li><li>Creating an internal playbook or guide for engineering leads on using the ladder.</li><li>Coaching others through delegation and control handoff.</li></ul><p>When you share how autonomy works in practice not just theory you elevate your leadership presence across the org and beyond.</p><h2 id=should-you-focus-on-the-freedom-ladder>Should <em>you</em> focus on the Freedom Ladder?</h2><p>If you find yourself burned out or blocking others, you may be holding on to too much control. Alternatively, if you’ve delegated and chaos ensued, perhaps you jumped rungs too quickly.</p><p>Use the Freedom Ladder as a <em>diagnostic tool</em>:</p><ul><li>Are you giving too much freedom without enough support?</li><li>Are you slowing things down by not trusting others to act?</li><li>Are your team members clear on where they stand?</li></ul><p>Staff-plus leadership isn’t about controlling more it’s about <em>controlling less, better</em>.</p><hr><blockquote><p>🧠 <em>&ldquo;The goal isn’t to climb the ladder alone—it’s to build a team that climbs together.&rdquo;</em><br>Great leaders create space for others to rise, responsibly.</p></blockquote></div></div></article><div class="mt4 ph3 mw8 center"><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Previous chapter: </span><a href=/guides/flexing-leadership-style/>Flexing Your Leadership Style</a></p><p class=f5><span class="b mb3">Next chapter: </span><a href=/guides/situational-leadership/>Understanding Situational Leadership - A Practical Guide with Engineer-Manager Scenarios</a></p></div></main><footer class="bg-white bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="center f4 fw4 dim no-underline black-50 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://srikanthdoddi.com/>&copy; Srikanth Doddi 2025</a></div></footer></body></html>
