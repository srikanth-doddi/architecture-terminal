Core Concept of Situational Leadership
Situational Leadership rests on the idea that leaders must adjust their style based on the readiness (ability and willingness) of their followers. The model identifies four leadership styles and matches them to the four development levels of employees."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.152.2"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="map[name:Srikanth Doddi]"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.efe4d852f731d5d1fbb87718387202a97aafd768cdcdaed0662bbe6982e91824.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/static/pygments.css><link rel=canonical href=https://techleadmanager.com/guides/situational-leadership/><meta property="og:url" content="https://techleadmanager.com/guides/situational-leadership/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="From Code to Influence: A Software Engineer’s Journey"><meta property="og:title" content="Understanding Situational Leadership - A Practical Guide with Engineer-Manager Scenarios"><meta property="og:description" content="Situational Leadership is a flexible and adaptive leadership model developed by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard.

He’s eager to learn but has no experience with the company’s tech stack.</em></p><p><strong>Leader&rsquo;s Style:</strong> Directing</p><p><strong>Interaction Example:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Leader:</strong><br>&ldquo;Charan, I’ve outlined a task for you to implement a REST API endpoint. Here’s the spec, and I’ve created a template project for you to use. Please follow the checklist and check in your code by Friday. Let’s meet daily for 15 minutes to track progress.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why it works:</strong><br>Clear structure helps Charan focus on learning the basics without ambiguity.</p><h3 id=s2-coaching-d2--developing-engineer>S2: <strong>Coaching</strong> (D2 – Developing Engineer)</h3><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br><em>Surya has been on the team for 3 months. He understands the tools but struggles with debugging and feels overwhelmed with sprint planning.</em></p><p><strong>Leader&rsquo;s Style:</strong> Coaching</p><p><strong>Interaction Example:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Engineer:</strong><br>&ldquo;I’m struggling with tracing the root cause of this bug. I’ve looked at the logs, but it’s still unclear.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Leader:</strong><br>&ldquo;Let’s walk through it together. I’ll explain how to approach log tracing and ask guiding questions. After this, I want you to handle a similar issue next time, and we’ll review it together.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why it works:</strong><br>Surya gains hands-on learning and support while his confidence builds.</p><h3 id=s3-supporting-d3--capable-but-insecure-engineer>S3: <strong>Supporting</strong> (D3 – Capable but Insecure Engineer)</h3><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br><em>Yashwanth is technically sound but has recently taken on a lead role in a cross-functional project and is hesitant in decision-making.</em></p><p><strong>Leader&rsquo;s Style:</strong> Supporting</p><p><strong>Interaction Example:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>Engineer:</strong><br>&ldquo;I’m not sure if we should go with GraphQL or REST for the data layer. I don’t want to make the wrong call.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Leader:</strong><br>&ldquo;You’ve researched both thoroughly. Let’s talk it through, but I trust your judgment. Which do you feel is the better fit?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why it works:</strong><br>This empowers Yashwanth to step into decision-making with backup if needed, building his confidence.</p><h3 id=s4-delegating-d4--senior-engineer>S4: <strong>Delegating</strong> (D4 – Senior Engineer)</h3><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br><em>Azhar is a senior backend engineer who’s led several successful releases.

I’ll handle external stakeholder communication if needed. Let me know if you hit any roadblocks—but otherwise, I trust you to own it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Why it works:</strong><br>Azhar thrives on autonomy and doesn’t need close supervision.</p><h2 id=benefits-of-situational-leadership>Benefits of Situational Leadership</h2><ul><li><em>Adaptability:</em> Leaders can respond effectively to changing team dynamics.</li><li><em>Employee Development:</em> Encourages growth by adjusting support based on capability.</li><li><em>Efficiency:</em> Reduces micromanagement and promotes autonomy where appropriate.</li><li><em>Better Engagement:</em> Helps keep employees motivated and connected to their roles.</li></ul><h2 id=challenges-and-considerations>Challenges and Considerations</h2><ul><li><em>Assessment Accuracy:</em> Misjudging an employee’s development level can lead to mismatches.</li><li><em>Time-Intensive:</em> Constantly adapting styles can be demanding.</li><li><em>Leader Flexibility:</em> Not all leaders are naturally skilled at switching styles.</li></ul><h2 id=tips-for-applying-situational-leadership-in-engineering-teams>Tips for Applying Situational Leadership in Engineering Teams</h2><ol><li><em>Regularly assess technical and emotional readiness</em> of your engineers.</li><li><em>Hold 1:1s</em> to gauge confidence, engagement, and skill gaps.</li><li><em>Balance mentorship and autonomy</em> based on development stage.</li><li><em>Document your style shifts</em> so team members understand changes.</li><li><em>Use retrospectives</em> to reflect on what support worked and what didn’t.</li></ol><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Situational Leadership helps engineering managers become <em>adaptive, supportive, and results-oriented</em>.
